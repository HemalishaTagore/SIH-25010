## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Introducing AgriWeave AI – a voice-first farming assistant that works on any phone, even without internet. Farmers can communicate to it through mobile app and it was integrated with  WhatsApp chatbot to get instant, personalized crop advice. It blends computer vision, language smarts, and predictive analytics with ISRO’s satellite data, farmers own inputs, and even informations from local traditions and Vedic texts. This is an all in one simple tool for better farming.

Features of AgriWeave AI:
    1. Voice-activated interface: Farmers can interact with this AI via voice in 27+ Indian languages like Tamil, English, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati… without even typing their queries.
    2. Pest/disease detections: Users can upload their crop image and the AI will detect the issues by referring to ICAR's guidelines and gives the organic fertilizers and solutions for it without the usage of chemicals.
    3. Community Weave network: Farmers can build their network with other farmers and agricultural experts for discussing their problems. They can also advertise their crops for sale, and track the order/delivery details.
    4. Progress controller: Monitors the grow of the crops and plants and also updates the result.


## Technical Approach
Technologies that I have used to build this AI featured app are:
    1. For voice and language support - whisper.ai, VoiceOver iOS, Flutter.
    2. For data blending and prediction - ISRO's Bhuvan API, GPS tracking system, and python.
    3. App design - Adobe XD, WhatsApp Business API integration.
    4. For Database and offline storage - SQLite, MongoDB, AWS S3, Firebase Realtime DB.
    5. For Architecture and Server Setuo - Node.js, Cloud Hosting.

## Feasibility and Viability
    90% of the features were made for offline use, so that everyone can utilize it well. It is user-friendly ai with guides. Allows partnerships/ collaboration for sales, Encrypted data, AI audit with ICAR for 95%+ accuracy.

## Impact and Benefits
    Useful for all farmers for improving their yield. Prromotes organiv farming, reduces chemical usage, enhanced food security.
